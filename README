Description:

This plugin implements displaying, recording and replaying teletext
based subtitles using the on screen display.


Long Description:

The teletext decoder/displayer is currently very basic and limited. It
can't show colours and it doesn't take into account the editors
attempts to place the text on different places on the screen.

The DVB drivers from the Metzlers as of late February 2003 and
Convergence/linuxtv.org as of March 5 2003 have firmware fixes against
OSD problems. (Thanks a lot guys!) An upgrade to either of those is
strongly recommended. If the plugin is used with earlier firmware,
data may get lost when the OSD is updated possibly resulting in bad
video and audio, especially when recording or playing recordings.

Both the live displayer and the recorder finds subtitling PID and page
for the selected language, and optionally for the hearing impaired, by
scanning the DVB Service Information. You don't have to set up channel
Tpids. Though, if you have set a Sid it will be used to speed up
Service Information scanning. (Can't say it makes much of a
difference, though).

The recorder writes a filtered subset of the teletext data with only
the subtitle pages and an index page at page 100 (or subsequent page
if that page number is used for subtitling). The filtered stream is
written as a private_stream_1 with subtype 0x1f (the last teletext
subtype). An ordinary teletext PES stream recorded for example by
setting Dpid1 to a teletext PID will typically have a subtype of
0x10.

The recording player scans the index page to find the selected
language. (If it can't find an index page it will use the page number
from the current channel. This may be removed in the future.) The
index page itself can't be viewed with this plugin.

If you can't select your language, look up its 3 letter acronym in
<http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/englangn_ascii.html> and/or
check the output from ttxtsubs, and enter the language code in your
VDR setup.conf at ttxtsubs.language. This will hopefully be easier in
a future release.

Consider this code alpha quality. The code could use some major
cleanup. The program design was from the beginning just not, as it
started as a test hack, and it has from then been incompletely
reworked a few times.


Installation:

This plugin is for VDR >= 1.6.0. It currently needs a few hooks in, and
changes to, VDR to work. A patch file is included and it should
be harmless if you don't have the plugin loaded, so even if you patch
VDR and later decide not to use this plugin you don't necessarily have
to reinstall VDR. It is probably possible to build the plugin for
other version of VDR, but don't count on it.
