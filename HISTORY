VDR Plugin 'ttxtsubs' Revision History
--------------------------------------

2011-10-08: Version 0.2.4
- Updated patch for VDR 1.7.21 (Closes #745)

  !!! With this release the channels.conf format has changed !!!
  !!! You may need to manually update your channels.conf     !!!

  With VDR 1.7.21 the subtitle PIDs are stored in the channels.conf as an
  extension to the teletext PID (see vdr.5 for details).

  This change made it neccessary to change the extension of the tpid in
  channels.conf used by the ttxtsubs patch:

  old: ...:201;150=deu,151=fin:...
  new  ...:201+150=deu,151=fin;2001,2002:...

  ...where 201 is the TPID, 150 and 151 are the teletext pages for the
  German and Finnish teletext subtitles and 2001,2002 are the DVB
  subtitle PIDs.

2004-05-31: Version 0.0.5
- Note:
This version is intended for VDR 1.2.6. There is a patch for VDR 1.3.5
included. It may or may not work with later VDR versions. Also see
Rolf's patch in the contrib directory.

This may be the last version for VDR 1.2.x, as I hope to start turning
my attention to VDR 1.3.x now.

- New features:
  - Italian translation, thanks to Sean Carlos
  - French translation, thanks to Stéphane Esté-Gracias
  - German translation, thanks to Tobias Grimm
  - Another ElchiAIO fix, thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg
  - Added a "contrib" directory with a VDR 1.3.8 test patch from
    Rolf Ahrenberg
  - Added a TROUBLESHOOTING document because of reports from Germany
    that ttxtsubs doesn't work there. It seems that most German channels
    on the birds at 19.2E don't announce the subtitles in their Service
    Information. Please see the document for further info.

- Bugs fixed:
  - Corrected (again!) national charset selection bit swapping, there
    was a typo in the fix in 0.0.5pre1.

2004-03-02: Version 0.0.5pre2
- New features:
  - Text colours can be set and row spacing can be adjusted.
    (The usual semitransparent "background" colour appearently
     doesn't work with the ElchiAIO patch, don't know why.)
    Thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg for the patch!
  - ttxtsubs menus can now be translated to different languages.
    Thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg for the patch!
    English, Finnish and Swedish now included, others are welcome!
- Bugs fixed:
  - Information for channels with no teletext at all is now cached
    too, making channel switches to such channels faster.

- Note:
  - The VDR 1.2.x patch "VDR.patch" is the same as in ttxtsubs 0.0.4b,
    and the 0.0.4 and 0.0.3d patch should work equally well - there is
    no need to repatch if you previously used any of those.

2004-03-01: Version 0.0.5pre1
- New features:
  - More than one language can be chosen, they are used in order of preference
  - Handles languages with two ISO 639-2 identifiers (as ger/deu, fre/fra)
  - Subtitles can now be turned on or off
  - Optional main menu alternative for easy access
  - Selectable vertical position of text for 4:3/Anamorphic or Letterbox 
  - Left, Center or Right horizontal position of text
  - Remapping option for those French channels that incorrectly
    sends teletext page numbers in decimal instead of hexadecimal.
    Very moderate remapping done at the moment, I hope it is enough.
  - Subtitles are now recorded with their PTS (timestamps). Note that
    the timestamps are completely wrong on some channels, this
    may confuse uncareful subtitle extracting software.
  - Included patch for VDR 1.3.5 - untested!
- Bugs fixed:
  - Fixed a net-to-host-order bug in the si parser that could make it
    incorrectly think that there are no subtitles on a channel.
    Thanks to Nicolas "tarass"!
  - Fixed a bit swapping bug causing incorrect character encoding for
    some languages. Thanks to Nicolas "tarass"!
